This is a public commit log that just tracks various projects I have on Github to kind of show a nice flow of things.

It's heavily inspired by the facepunch (developers of the game, Rust) commits log which they have at https://commits.facepunch.com

I thought it's really cool, and decided to implement something very similar.

### v1.1 (in development)
